Festival is an application built for macOS only.
It is heavily inspired by Partytime.
My goal was the create a similar app that would have the same purpose but with my own touch to it.
Of course I could just contribute to their project but I wouldn't learn that much from it,
creating my own version from scratch without looking at how they did it would be a huge challenge.
At the end of the day, it was totally worth it!

The only thing Festival differs from Partytime is the status bar,
it is able to display the current status, some of them includes
* Unkown contact
* Not a number
* Amount of messages delivered
* Not a contact
* Permissions success
* Permissions required
* etc
